Partial Updates with HTTP Patch using JSON Patch document
===========================================================


JSON Patch is specified in [RFC 6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) from the IETF.

We use the HTTP PATCH method to apply partial updates to a resource. This means that, if we have a resource, and we want to update only a few fields of this, and not all, this is the HTTP method we should use.
